"265652","B0171QF5R8","Herbal Tea Sleep Aid w/ Chamomile , Valerian Root & Lemon Balm in Tea Bags - Aids Anxiety & Stress Relief - Thoughtful Gifts For Women","When people read the word “detox” they assumed weigh loss immediately. What people fail to learn or know is that the word “detox” or “cleanse” means flushing bad waste from your system. A lot of people assume that by drinking this tea you will automatically lose weight. Well if you plan on expecting that to happen, I suggest you to stop looking for weight loss tea and start looking at weight loss surgery because a product like that does not exist. If you want to lose weight, you need to change your lifestyle which includes changing the way you eat and changing your fitness routine. Hey Girl tea is a unique tea I’ve ever had, it smells beautiful and tastes delicious to me. This tea is not designed for weight loss but rather helps you flush regularly. CLEANSE This was the first kind of tea I tried to get started. I was sad to see that the tea was looseleaf however no where on the product mentioned it was tea bags so that was my fault for not catching that. It wasn’t the end of the world for me since I purchased empty tea bags for looseleaf tea. I was very impressed with the smell and taste. It has this beautiful fruit like smell and taste just like it. I’ve tried other detox tea and it usually tastes bitter. Hey Girl is definitely my number one favorite for tea. I recommend this product and will pass it on to friends and family. SLEEP I wanted to try this out because I have a sleeping disorder where I lack sleep. I work in NYC where I am required to be up at 5AM and catch a train at 5:30AM. There are many days where I only have 3-5 hours of sleep due to my sleeping disorder. When I drink this tea before 8PM, it works wonders. I am drowsy around 9PM which gives me a healthy 8 hours of sleep! If I drink this after 8PM, it is a hit or miss on my body. (Remember everyone’s body is different) My body just takes longer to react to the drowsiness. MINT I have a big sweet tooth and I usually crave sweets at night which I know isn’t good for you. Now, I don’t really know if this tea really works (preventing you from craving sweets) or if it’s all in my head. When I really want a chocolate cake at night, I end up drinking this. It’s not that the tea makes me not want the cake anymore….more like I kinda forgot I wanted the chocolate cake before. However, I did noticed since I started drinking this, I consumed less sweets. FEEL BETTER I purchased this tea as a precautious for those days I’m under the weather. I am very thankful that I did because I really believed this was a lifesaver. After I took this tea, I was better the next day and it was a miracle! I remembered my throat was in pain and this tea really helps soothes my throat. ENERGIZE After trying all the other Hey Girl teas, I decided to give this a shot as well. All the other teas have been great for me, why not try this right? I drink this after my morning yoga class and I am extremely thankful. Usually after a one hour hot yoga class, I am exhausted! Thanks to the Hey Girl Energize tea, I have energy for the rest of my day (it even last till 10PM)!",5,"people read word detox assume weigh loss immediately people fail learn know word detox cleanse mean flush bad waste system lot people assume drink tea automatically lose weight well plan expect happen suggest stop look weight loss tea start look weight loss surgery product like exist want lose weight need change lifestyle include change way eat change fitness routine hey girl tea unique tea ever smell beautiful taste delicious tea design weight loss rather help flush regularly cleanse first kind tea try get start sad see tea looseleaf however product mention tea bag fault catch end world since purchase empty tea bag looseleaf tea impress smell taste beautiful fruit like smell taste like try detox tea usually taste bitter hey girl definitely number one favorite tea recommend product pass friends family sleep want try sleep disorder lack sleep work nyc require catch train many days hours sleep due sleep disorder drink tea pm work wonder drowsy around pm give healthy hours sleep drink pm hit miss body remember everyone body different body take longer react drowsiness mint big sweet tooth usually crave sweets night know good really know tea really work prevent crave sweets head really want chocolate cake night end drink tea make want cake anymore like kinda forget want chocolate cake however notice since start drink consume less sweets feel better purchase tea precautious days weather thankful really believe lifesaver take tea better next day miracle remember throat pain tea really help soothe throat energize try hey girl teas decide give shoot well teas great try right drink morning yoga class extremely thankful usually one hour hot yoga class exhaust thank hey girl energize tea energy rest day even last till pm"

I do sometimes still wake up in the middle of the night, but instead of jolting awake and having to get up for a couple of hours, I go back to sleep. I'd noticed that my husband was tossing and turning at night so offered him a cup of this tea. He falls asleep almost immediately and sleeps longer than he'd been sleeping. I like the taste of the tea and it is easy to prepare. I do wish it were a little less expensive, or that there were more teabags in the package, but if I sleep, I can overlook that.

I made myself a cup and sat down around 10 (mom's you know why! Haha), put on Good Wife, drank my delicious hot tea... And was out in less than 10 minutes. O-U-T. Aside from the 5 bags I've given away, each bag has helped me relax and fall asleep in less than 15 minutes.

Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t.  So testing this out, I started taking this in place of the Melatonin. The first few times, it seemed to work one night and not the other and now it is about as repeatable as the Melatonin.  Sometimes it just does not compensate for my overly busy mind.  (Must be writing specs and reviews in my sleep). Per the box the ingredients are: Organic Lemon Balm Leaf Extract 300mg L-Theanine (from Green Tea Extract) 100mg Organic Valerian Root Extract 50mg Organic Passionflower Extract 50mg Organic Chamomile Flower Extract 50mg Probiotic Blend 4mg **Bifidobacterium lactis BI-04 **Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14 Just realized in reading this that it had Lactobacillus acidophilus which I don’t tolerate really well since I’m lactose intolerant. I have not had any issues, but it might be due to the low mg.  Some people also might be more sensitive or I might have issues over time. Since this is 3X the cost of the melatonin, and no more effective, I plan to switch back to that when this bottle empties out. When I looked up the components to this pill, I noted that it appears to be an encompassing set of herbs that all promote relaxation in different ways. Most are well below the efficacy level of these meds, so their hope must be in the combination. Some of these pills like Lemon Balm have some issues with other meds, so it is a good thing that it is so low. Otherwise these pills would need some sort of disclaimer. Lemon balm could be problematic with other meds more than the others and the recommended dosage that I was seeing on the web was in the grams. 8-10, not mg. So this is a very low dosage. L-Theanine is known to help relax anxiety in doses from 250 - 400 mg. This pill is a less than half of that. I looked up Valerian on the web, as I seem to recall some contraindications for its usage. While I didn’t find any glaring issues the WebMD site indicated that the dosage to be effective for sleep is about 400-900 mg, 2 hours before bed time.  This pill has an eighth of the lowest dose recommended. Chamomile is a tea that I will drink when I can’t sleep.  It too is present in this pill. The max dosage of chamomile you can take daily is about 1600 mg and they suggest the max amount of tea at 4 cups, so maybe a cup of tea is equivalent to 400 mg?  I don’t know as I can’t find any conversion info. As this pill has 50mg it is well below that max.",3,"rarely sleep well normally take melatonin mg night sometimes help sometimes test start take place melatonin first time seem work one night repeatable melatonin sometimes compensate overly busy mind must write specs review sleep per box ingredients organic lemon balm leaf extract mg l theanine green tea extract mg organic valerian root extract mg organic passionflower extract mg organic chamomile flower extract mg probiotic blend mg bifidobacterium lactis bi lactobacillus acidophilus la realize read lactobacillus acidophilus tolerate really well since lactose intolerant issue might due low mg people also might sensitive might issue time since x cost melatonin effective plan switch back bottle empty look components pill note appear encompass set herbs promote relaxation different ways well efficacy level meds hope must combination pills like lemon balm issue meds good thing low otherwise pills would need sort disclaimer lemon balm could problematic meds others recommend dosage see web grams mg low dosage l theanine know help relax anxiety dose mg pill less half look valerian web seem recall contraindications usage find glare issue webmd site indicate dosage effective sleep mg hours bed time pill eighth lowest dose recommend chamomile tea drink sleep present pill max dosage chamomile take daily mg suggest max amount tea cup maybe cup tea equivalent mg know find conversion info pill mg well max"
"567660","B07G2LBML3","Garden of Life mykind Organics Sleep Well Rest & Refresh 30 Tablets, Lemon Balm, Green Tea Extract L-Theanine, Valerian Root, Chamomile, Probiotics-Organic Non-GMO Vegan Gluten Free Herbal Supplement","I've had issues with insomnia most of my life and have used Ambien, Lunesta, Sleep Aid (from Kirkland) and also Melantonin.  This product from Garden of Life is probably most closely associated with my experience with Melatonin.  It is natural solution to better sleep and it does not leave you feeling hung over or slightly drugged like some of the other choices might do. It claims to ""relax you"" to help you sleep, and that it does.  You are not going to feel an immediate effect from it, it takes about an hour or so (for me) to start feeling its effect.  Once asleep, I do seem to sleep in a deeper state with it than I do with the other options....I actually dream more. If you want something with a stronger punch that does not require a prescription, then I suggest Sleep Aid from Kirkland, which you can actually get right here on Amazon.  Amazon no longer allows a product link in their reviews for some reason, but you can copy/paste Kirkland Sleep Aid to locate it.  If you go this route, I suggest you only start off with half a pill instead of a whole one.  It really packs a punch that you might feel throughout the next morning (your mileage may vary).

On some nights, it just didn't seem to do anything, but two nights I actually ended up feeling restless and waking up countless times during the night. I've had similar disappointing effects using valerian alone in the past, but I was hoping that this combination of ingredients (which also includes L-Theanine, which I have found useful in the past) would deliver, but so far the results have been very disappointing and about as far from restful as it gets. It  might just be that my sleep troubles are more severe than this is really capable of handling, but the fact that I've actually become more restless after taking it isn't what I was expecting.

The basic formula is (organic) lemon balm leaf extract, L-Theanine, Valerian Root, Passionflower, Chamomile Flower and a probiotic blend. Each ingredient has been studied for its calming effect.  Chamomile tea has long been consumed as a sleep aid.  Passionflower extract is also a supplement that has been used historically to treat anxiety and insomnia.  Valerian root is well known for reducing anxiety and promoting sleep.  I've used Valerian Root for years to calm and relax.  Lemon balm is part of the mint family and is also well known for its anti-anxiety properties and its calming effects.  L-Thenine is one I was less familiar with and had to look it up.  L-Thenine is an amino acid found in green tea.  Normally when you think of green tea, you consider it's moderate caffeine content and would think its use in a sleep promoter would be contradictory.  But this is just one of many compounds found in green tea.  L-Theanine does promote a reduction in anxiety (with a secondary effect of promoting sleep). Based on a cursory review of the ingredients, the general theme of this supplement is: reduce anxiety to promote a restful mind. The big question is whether it works.  I tried the recommended dose (1 tablet) before bedtime.  In my case, 1h before bedtime.  It does work for me.  I felt a relaxing calm state of mind and was drifting off before I knew it.  Kava can produce similar effects but it can be dangerous for your liver.  Nothing in this is dangerous to liver function. If you have occasional insomnia, this is a great supplement to help you reduce anxiety/stress and clear your mind for restful sleep.  You could also purchase the ingredients separately or as tea blends if tea is your thing.  But I like the convenience of having all of these ingredients in one easy to take supplement.  I would recommend it.",5,"use several garden life brand supplement daily want try sleep well formula help unwind stressful day fall asleep quickly basic formula organic lemon balm leaf extract l theanine valerian root passionflower chamomile flower probiotic blend ingredient study calm effect chamomile tea long consume sleep aid passionflower extract also supplement use historically treat anxiety insomnia valerian root well know reduce anxiety promote sleep use valerian root years calm relax lemon balm part mint family also well know anti anxiety properties calm effect l thenine one less familiar look l thenine amino acid find green tea normally think green tea consider moderate caffeine content would think use sleep promoter would contradictory one many compound find green tea l theanine promote reduction anxiety secondary effect promote sleep base cursory review ingredients general theme supplement reduce anxiety promote restful mind big question whether work try recommend dose tablet bedtime case h bedtime work felt relax calm state mind drift know kava produce similar effect dangerous liver nothing dangerous liver function occasional insomnia great supplement help reduce anxiety stress clear mind restful sleep could also purchase ingredients separately tea blend tea thing like convenience ingredients one easy take supplement would recommend"

I’m a night owl so, that alone makes it harder for me to go to sleep cuz I’d rather be up at night, which means I subconsciously fight sleep lol. That, coupled with my anxiety issues and my complete inability to shut off my mind, keeps me awake into the wee hours of the morning. I do have an Rx sleep aid (Seroquel).

I have to take anywhere between 3-4 to fall asleep. Until I bought these. I was very skeptical because it takes so much prescription strength medicine to get me to sleep; how could an “all natural” supplement get me to sleep?! But, figured I’d give it a try...what did I have to lose besides $16??? So glad I did! I take 2 of these to get me into a sleepy mood.

I'd never dealt with jet lag before, so I wanted to be prepared and stave it off if I could. I saw good reviews for this product, and it's all-natural, so I figured I'd give it a try. First of all, the container is larger than a typical pill bottle, so it may be tough to pack if you're maxing out your bag. I wedged it into a bottom corner of my carry-on backpack and it was fine there. The product itself worked great for me. The gummies are chewier than your typical fruit snacks, and you need to make sure you've chewed it well enough before swallowing. After taking two gummies (10 mg of melatonin), I feel drowsy within thirty minutes and fall asleep shortly after putting my head to the pillow. For travelers, I recommend trying this product at home first, just to make sure you don't experience any side effects. I took these on an overnight flight and rested quite well; I then continued taking them the first few nights in Europe in order to force my body clock to adjust. It didn't take more than a couple days to be fully adjusted to the local time zone. No waking up in the middle of the night or feeling sleepy mid-afternoon! One concern I had was taking these into (and out of) the EU. My understanding is that melatonin is not sold over-the-counter in Europe, so I hoped these wouldn't be confiscated at security or customs. Fortunately, that was not the case. Perhaps they have relaxed the rules, perhaps I'm misinformed, or perhaps I just got lucky. As they say, know before you go. I will be sure to purchase more of these for future trips. If you're a light or inconsistent sleeper, it might be a good idea to keep some of these on-hand. I call myself a picky sleeper because I require a certain amount of tiredness and total darkness in order to fall asleep—but with these gummies, all bets are off.

I’m going to be generous as hell and say that has given me six hours of sleep a night. So from ’05 – ’11 was six more years of “normal” as I had previously written. That’s 52 “extra days” per year time six more years which equals 300 days, or, another year. So that’s now 04 years added to my life. 07 years of 06 hours sleep per night = 02 hours “extra time” x 365 days/year = 730 hours ÷ 30 days x 07 years = 210 days which, again, because I am being generous, is one more year added to my life. That’s 05 years “extra” I have lived by simply not sleeping. So I am sitting here at almost 66 years old. That makes me 71 in terms of being “awake”.

My mind just wanders, and continues to work out issues. I decided to try looking into supplement options. Research showed gaba ""is used for increasing the sense of well-being, relieving injuries, improving exercise tolerance, decreasing body fat, and increasing lean body weight."" This product contains both melatonin and gaba, as well as other powerful ingredients like St. John's wart, chamomile, goji, and B vitamins. The pills help me fall asleep quicker and wake up refreshed in the morning. No medicine head or feeling groggy. The pills are easy to swallow and leave no aftertaste. I generally take them about 45 min before bed. Anxiety formula The combination of these herbs, ASHWAGANDHA, St. John's Wort, Valeria, Gaba, 5-HTP, Chamomile, B-Vitamins, are what gives this supplement a leg up to your basic bottle of St John's wort. Alot of these are already added to your calming teas and bedtime supplements because they have been proven to reduce anxiety and increase your sense of well being. I love the fact that they are an all natural alternative to prescription medicines, which can have some nasty side effects. Not only does it help with overall mood but assists in going to sleep quicker. Which we all know can help your mental and physical health. Would definitely recommend for those with situational anxiety or mild panic. The bottle was very easy to open but first whiff when opened was pretty strong (typical herb smell). They do recommend 2 a day but may need to start at one per day.

I struggle with both anxiety and insomnia but I love life and people so I have been looking for answers that deal with the core physical issues instead of just putting a bandaid on them. I have been taking sublingual B12 for years and B shots which have helped with anxiety, headaches, energy etc. I've also taken anxiety RX: Citalopram, Paxil, etc. They are great for replacing chemicals in the brain that are at low levels. But how did they get that way. I want to treat the problem so I can avoid the negative outcomes. I love life and people but I think part of my anxiety is a genetic hyperactivity and being a people pleaser so I really really need the B vitamins that are easily absorbed in Anxiety Formula. And the magnesium helps my restless legs, something I've dealt with for the past few years.Regular B vitamins really hurt my stomach since I have low acid. But I've been able to take Anxiety Formula several times a day without stomach problems. I'm staying ahead of  headaches or panic attacks. EZ Rest Sleep Formula is great. Anyone who deals with anxiety tends to struggle getting to sleep and/or staying asleep. Sometimes I just stay up because there is no point in tossing and turning. I've been taking two Sleep Formula tablets for about a week and am sleeping much better. I'm recovering from rotator cuff surgery and the pain meds keep me awake. After a sleepless night I actually took Sleep Formula and was able to take a 3 hour nap during the day. The formula has not only melatonin and valerian but L-Trryptophan which I used successfully 20 years ago. Plus B6. So it is really treating the problem, not just putting a bandaid on it. I would definitely recommend this combination. I take more than prescribed since I have pretty extreme anxiety and insomnia but stick with the directions and test it out for yourself.

The anxiety and sleep combination pack has been wonderful for him and both my son and myself are happy with the results.  The first day my son took the anxiety pill, he noticed a difference in his mood, literally by mid day I noticed he was calmer.  He has been using these for awhile and the fact he is calmer, he feels less stressed and doesn't get angry as fast, it really has been because of using the anxiety pill.  I say that because he hasn't been taking anything prescribed for his anxiety, the only mood elevator has been using is this pill.  To go from always being on edge to a calmer and joyful mood, I cannot say enough about this product. I myself used the sleep pill and within about a hour, I knew it had worked because I was asleep.  I didn't feel jittery or dizzy, I simply was relaxed enough to fall asleep.  They only ""side effect"" I will call it, is mild loose stools that occur after the first day of using these pills.  When my son and I compare results, he agreed he also had the same side effect but we think it's because the label reads a vegetable ingredient.  We all know what vegetables do and that side effect was tolerable.  Does the sleep pill help you fall asleep?  Yes. Does the anxiety pill work?  Yes. It really is a good feeling to know I purchased a product that helps him.

This natural sleep aid is made with Vitamin B6 - 1 mg, Pantothenic Acid - 50 mg, Magnesium - 40 mg, GABA - 180 mg, L-Theanine - 120 mg, Chamomile - 75 mg, Passion Flower Extract - 20 mg, Hops Extract - 20 mg, Lemon Balm - 10 mg, so as you can see its all natural and that's what makes this product the best. I will add in that even though I feel asleep quickly, I did not sleep through the night but when I woke I did not have a hard time falling back to sleep, that's my reason for the 4 star review. I'm happy w/my purchase and happy to say I finally feel complete again.

We had tried another calming blend from a local healthy living store and the results were good, but when they were out of their blend for a period of time, we tried the Planetary blend.  The results were better and our son preferred the taste of Planetary's blend over the other blend.

This is a product we have been using for over a year and will continue to use in the foreseeable future.

I have ordered my second bottle. I tell you the difference in his take home folder from school is amazing. He went from notes every day to smiling faces every day. Everyone notices the difference and asks if he is feeling ok. He is calmer, more focused. To be clear: I give him 1/2 teaspoon (per bottle) of Planetary Formulas Calm Child Syrup (twice daily before and after school) and one adult fish oil daily (before school). It works for him. I tried the tablets they worked but he cannot swallow tablets and they are not chewable (he says they taste horrible if chewed) so I purchased the syrup. Here is the big one. He has NOT taken Adderall since I started PFCCS. I filled his last prescription just in case but it is still in the bag unopened. I know it is frustrating for parents to find what works for their child. I wanted to be clear because I have found some reviews are not clear in dosage or just regimen. I am not faithful in watching my son’s sugar, dye.etc intake meaning I know many suggest Gluten, sugar and dye free diets. I don’t see either of them happening in our household, we like to eat.

Sometimes so bad that her face turned purple. I'd been taking magnesium for my anxiety for about a year, when I started to wonder if they made some kind of natural remedy for kids also. When I started looking at the ingredients in most of the calming remedies for kids, they all had magnesium, but so much sugar. So when I found this one(at a local vitamin shoppe) I thought I'd just give it a try and see how well it worked. We needed something, we were planning to move a long ways and needed to take a bus, so screaming fits definitely would make the move alot harder to handle. First off, the 2oz bottle said it had about 23 servings. Well, 3 months later and we still have about a months worth left. We probably are only using half as much as recommended, but it's working well so far and I don't want to hinder that. Secondly, we tried this in unison with a multivitamin that she said tasted terrible, so maybe that made her think the drops tasted even better, but she still says she really likes the taste. Thirdly, she hasn't had a fit ever since she started taking these drops. She's also 7 now, 6 when we started them. Maybe that has an impact on how much to take. After dealing with these screaming fits for close to 2 years, I can't express the relief that we both feel after having them removed from our lives. So many of the things that used to trigger her fits, don't anymore. Noise, people, simple changes or ""transition"" times, don't effect her anymore. I'm tearing up a little as I'm typing this, life is so much easier and more enjoyable for both of us now, we get to just be a family now. Thank you so much for making this stuff!!

While there are no cures for Alzheimers, they do find that toxins and inflammation do the damage that can result in this frightening disease that is so hard on families.  Having too many ""brain farts"" to ignore, I set out to do what I could -- on multiple fronts. So when I looked for supplements I could trust, I knew I wanted a brand that was very conscientious in the sources of their ingredients, with the strength I needed, and at a price I could still afford.  I'm so happy to have found a review of supplements that put Naturelo at the top, and then to find they have a very full line of products. Sleep is just one of the many products I now order regularly.  It's an important one because getting enough sleep is my biggest weakness.  Even when I miss taking the whole handful of pills I set up to take daily, I do not ever miss taking Sleep, as well as the Naturelo Vitamin D3 (to counter Osteoporosis). I find that even if I don't think I'm ready for bed, the effect of Sleep, taken a half hour before laying down, is that I easily relax -- without any grogginess -- and I'm out.  I wake up easily in the morning. I am really glad I've found this company and recommend these products wholeheartedly.

At the end of March '19, that's 5,193,495 words. Two entries: Still Tuesday, April 03, 2018, 1230 So picking up where I left off this morning… It was right after the first of ’11 that I got an on-going prescription for Ambien/Zolpidem. I’m going to be generous as hell and say that has given me six hours of sleep a night. So from ’05 – ’11 was six more years of “normal” as I had previously written.

One time I was super tired, and gave him one pill and he fell asleep for about an hour, but then woke up again all groggy and lethargic.. So, this stuff did not work. Also, I felt really guilty because as natural as it claims to be, the serotonin is still an artificial drug that is made in a lab. It's not like it grows in a fluffy serotonin tree! So, you're still giving your kids sleeping pills, people. And another thing to think about is this: if your kid has nightmares, why would you give them something that keeps them from waking up? How would you like to be stuck in a nightmare that you can't wake up from for 8 hours. That's pretty cruel. So, suck it up, take one for your kids, and stay up with them if they wake up. It's hard, and it sucks (trust me, I know!), but your kid is more important than your convenience. Children do not need to be drugged for the parent's convenience. They need love and a TONNE of patience. Also vitamin B-1 almost always prevents nightmares FYI. And there is no better sleeping pill than taking your kids for a walk around the block in the evening, or a drive around town. And letting them go out and play during the day so they actually expend all their energy.

Naps were always short, and despite being an active kid who gets loads of wiggles out throughout the day, and who has a consistent and mellow bedtime routine since she was an infant, and who went through quite a bit of ""sleep training,"" she's rarely been able to sleep through the night. For a brief period of time, around 17-22 months, she did sleep in her own bed all night, but that was a momentary blip of bliss that has yet to organically return. We've tried giving lavender massages, adding calming essential oil blends to her bedroom diffuser, we've used a sound machine since she was a baby, we've tried stretching out bath time, turning down the lights much earlier, and so on. We've tried it all. The real deal insomnia runs in my family as does general trouble sleeping, and I did not want that fate for my daughter. So, now that my daughter is four, I felt it was time to up my game. I started researching natural remedies and came across LUNA. We've used it for the past two nights--giving a tablet to her before bathtime, and right after bathtime, she has been noticeably sleepy--even articulating, ""I'm sleepy"" (words previously never uttered from her sweet little mouth). After only one book into storytime, she was dozing off. I cannot believe it, but she has slept through the night--in her own bed--both nights she took LUNA. She even sleeps through her younger brother's occasional, dreamy squawks. She wakes in the morning well-rested and happy--quite a shift from the groggy little girl I'm used to. She's already showing signs of being proud of her ability to sleep, and--an added benefit I didn't expect--she hasn't wet her Pull-Up the last two nights--something else she's exceedingly proud of. My hunch is that we will use LUNA for a few weeks to help her body and mind form positive sleep habits, then back off for awhile and use LUNA to help maintain those healthy habits when necessary.

"1267062","B00U470TAK","Luna Kids | #1 Sleep Aid Tablets for Children & Sensitive Adults | Naturally Sourced Ingredients | Chewable Pills | Gentle Herbal Supplement with Chamomile, Melatonin, Valerian & Lemon Balm","My daughter was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in March, ten days after her 5th birthday. She had begun having trouble falling asleep at night around her third birthday. We always thought she was just a night owl, or that she had inherited sleep problems from me, but we came to learn that difficulty falling asleep was a symptom of this autoimmune disease in children. She would describe it to us as being unable close her eyes. They just wouldn’t shut. We figured out that she meant that she was very tired, but could not physically fall asleep. We had tried other natural children's melatonin supplements over the years, but even 1mg of melatonin was too much for her tiny body. She would wake up with night terrors every time she took them. Even when cut in half, she would have restless sleep and wake up much earlier than normal. Upon learning that this was a symptom of her disease and that she would need to take something regularly to help her fall asleep for the foreseeable future, I started looking for something new and stumbled upon Luna Kids. I loved how little melatonin was in it, that it was sugar free and dye free, and that it included other herbs and vitamins. Her pediatric endocrinologist was very happy to see the Vitamin D in it, since people with Hashi's are often deficient in it. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this product! I don’t worry about her taking it every night. It's the slight nudge she needs to fall asleep. On the occasional nights when one is not enough, I have no problem with her taking another, because I know it will not have any adverse effects on her. She has never had a night terror using Luna Kids. She has never woken up groggy, no matter how late she took it. I can let her older brother take one on the rare nights he can’t fall asleep, and I will do the same with her younger brother when he is of age to take it.

My 9 year old has had a tough time falling asleep since he was a baby. Way back then we'd make jokes about how he just wasn't a ""napper"" but that quickly lost its humor when we realized that he was always going to have these issues. By the time he was 3 or 4, it was becoming a real problem for us all. We have a great bedtime routine and are always careful to make sure that he gets the right amount of necessary vitamins and trace minerals paired warm baths, aromatherapy, sleepy time guided meditations and/or beta waves but frequently that wasn't enough. He struggled to fall asleep and would lay there for hours sometimes. He would tell us that he hated bedtime and just wished that he could fall asleep. I can relate as I also have difficulty falling asleep but seeing him go through it was terrible and made us all feel so helpless. I really hated to see him suffer. I knew we needed help but we're very naturally minded so I was hesitant to try just anything. I did a lot of research and spoke with his pediatrician about our options. I was worried about giving anything artificial or with too much Melatonin and his doctor agreed that those things weren't a good idea. We finally had a full panel blood and DNA test run on him and found out that he has a specific variation of the MTHFR mutation which can interfere with your body's natural Melatonin production! This was likely a very big reason why he was having such a hard time sleeping. He DID need to start on a supplement to get his natural production up and a push in the right direction every now and again. We introduced a high quality B12 (L-Methylfolate) vitamin to help with these things and started looking for a sleep supplement that we could use sporadically and would suit his needs. There are a few kids sleep aids out there that claim to be natural and gentle and we went through a couple before we found LUNA. I wanted to try the supplements myself before giving them to him to be sure that they weren't going to be too harsh. The first one we bought contained 1mg of Melatonin per tablet and suggested that you give someone in his age/weight range 2! I took two myself one night (a small dose for me, according to their packaging) and don't remember much after that. When I woke up the next day, I felt like I got hit by a truck. It was anything but pleasant and I certainly didn't feel well rested. More like I was waking up from having been passed out! The next aid we tried was a slightly lower dose of Melatonin but still seemed like too much for me (left me feeling groggy and out of it) so I was worried how he would react to it. (Not only that, they tasted terrible!). Next, I tried LUNA. I loved that it had a low dose of Melatonin (just enough!) was natural, gentle, and GMO-free. I wondered why I hadn't tried it first! It didn't taste bad, helped me to feel sleepy within about 30 minutes of taking them, and I slept soundly through the night. The next morning I woke refreshed like I hadn't taken anything at all. I felt good. I was sold! My son tried them the next time he was having a rough time getting to sleep and he was out within 45 minutes. This is amazing for him! He really likes his LUNA but only asks to take them on nights when he has tried other things and nothing seems to be working. I'd say he takes them 2-3 times a month, on average. They are gentle, non-habit forming, and help to get the job done. We suggest them to all of our friends. We're so glad that we found LUNA and will be customers for a long time to come!

Her son has ADHD and has a problem going to sleep at night. My son's doctor recommended we use Melatonin to help him sleep at night because he has pediatric insomnia. I liked this one because it was such a low dose, and finding something low enough was an issue. With one dose, he was fine. It helped him calm down at night enough to fall asleep. It didn't help with the constant waking, but at least he was going to bed at a decent time. Per the doctor's recommendation, because it wasn't working well anymore, I upped it to two doses at night. That meant he was taking two of the pills. This was still ultimately a low dose. The first time he took two, I noticed he was extra hyper. I chalked it up to a fluke. Then it happened the same way for the next three nights. I had to reach out to his doc, and send a picture of the ingredients to him. The sugar, though natural, could have been a major factor. Another could have been that he's sensitive to Melatonin. So, we switched to another brand that had no sugar or anything else. Just Melatonin. (He's not a fan of the taste) This one, which was a higher dosage, did not make him hyper and he is now only waking once each night. The point of this long explanation is a couple of things. 1. I think the Sugar content may be a smidge high. I get that it needs to taste good for kids to take it, but putting an upper in a downer can cause some issues. His doctor believes that was the issue we ran into. 2. It really depends on the kids. Through this experience, I learned that some people are very sensitive to Melatonin. It can cause night terrors and such. I honestly had no idea. I don't want to give this a bad review because it did help at the single dose and I know a few other parents that love it. However, the sugar content didn't work well with my son, which is ok. Just keep that in mind when you try this.

That's all I really have to say, lol, but I'll give detail... My poor sweet girl has had sleeping issues her whole life - just like me. We get tired, but very rarely can we fall asleep. As a newborn, we co-slept. It was great for awhile, but at 6 months she was waking every 30 minutes and would nurse for 2 minutes before falling asleep, not getting enough milk to satisfy her tummy. I (stupidly) listened to my (now ex) husband, who wanted her to stay in our bed, but wouldn't feed her or change diapers. He did on occasion rock her, which gave me some rest after we put her in her own crib, but he would summon me after some time had passed and she was still wide awake. If we laid her down, she would cry. She just wanted to be near people. So I decided it was time to leave her in her room, to get the message through that nighttime is for sleeping. He would still go in and get her out, then come get me. That went on until she was two, then I had my second child and we separated. Now I was parenting alone. My newborn adjusted quickly - co-sleeping until 6 months, then sleeping all night in her own crib, then in her own room. Amazing. My trouble-sleeper, on the other hand, NEVER SLEEPY. I tried everything - changing sleep routines, massages, oils, tea, meditations, stretches, herbal aids, NOTHING WORKED. So then I started on low doses of melatonin, which helped her fall asleep. But she still woke up at 12 and 3am, jittery, spastic, scared, lonely, nightmares... a lot of what I was going through personally manifesting in my daughter as well. I didn't want to give her too much, to the point where she was reliant on melatonin. I even took some her doses to see how it felt at night, and would wake up in a sleep-aid-hangover and felt spacy and spastic for half the day. She's 4 years old now, and I'm still trying to empower her to stay in her own bed, to roll over when she wakes, to take a sip of water, to go potty... A few successes that I can literally count on one hand. But every night is the same. If I send her back to bed at 12am, it's tears and screaming and ""please scratch my back, sing me a song, I don't want to be alone"" until she passes out. Then up at 3am, she's up, same rants, passing out, then up again until about 6am, when she's WIDE AWAKE and seems fine. I started looking at sleep aids for myself, and LUNA came up often. Then I saw LUNA Kids - let me say, I'm flat broke most of the time, I barely make an income, but I NEEDED these ASAP. Our first night, we both took one. I woke up naturally, early, and rested.

The packaging was up to standard although the bottle wasn't in a box, it had a plastic seal. I'm happy with the delivery and packaging. However, My little guy doesn't like this product. He is accustomed to taking the Zarbee's chewable melatonin. I tasted both myself. I have this weird thing about tasting anything new before my kids do. Well, the difference is that Luna is a much bigger chewable and it's more chalky than Zarbee's. Also, the flavor is a bit stronger. As an adult I didn't mind the difference, but my 4 year old noticed and refused to chew it. On another note, the Luna chewable made me much more drowsy in a shorter span of time than the Zarbee's. I don't think that one is better than the other. To be honest the Luna seemed stronger and quicker.

I go three - four days with only 2-4 hours of sleep and then on the 5th-6th day, fall asleep on the couch as soon as my husband walks in the door and sits down for dinner with the kids.  I hate taking medications, partially because I have to remember to take them and partially because I really do believe we overmedicate.  As for herbs, after being raised by a hippy granola mom, I am skeptical - just my personal opinion.  After a life time of struggling with sleep issues, I decided to seek out professional help.  I didm't want prescribed sleep aids so, at the advice of several medical professionals, I skeptically decided to try melatonin again. This time around, I had medical guidance regarding melatonin and learned that the present theory on melatonin is that micro amounts work better than large amounts. Luna Kids contains .2mg of melatonin. It also contains valerian root which I learned really does have a sedative effect (huh.  Turns out some of this herbal stuff does actually work.  People, I'm eating my words about all herbal supplements being quackery). At the suggestion of my doctor,  I've  made some changes to my life. Since my brain can't stop racing at night, clutter in the bedroom keeps my mind processing. I now have a very minimalist bedroom.  My nightstand is bare, except for a few items - book, clock, glass of water, morning medication.  I have created a bedtime routine and schedule. I take Luna Kids two hours before bedtime, when I begin my nightly prep for the next day and wrap up for the evening.  As someone with ADHD, it's hard to stay on target, but the schedule helps.  With Luna Kids, I am able to fall asleep.  Also, I do not wake up feeling drugged.  After a lifetime of not sleeping, I'm discovering how much my lack of sleep impacted my life.  On occasion, I have given it to my children.  They don't mind the taste, which is a rarity with them. I give them a quarter or a half a pill.  It works great.  I had my kids pediatrician look at Luna Kids before giving it to my children. I also had my doctor look at it. Both doctors were impressed with the product and now suggest it to their patients.  I love the fact Luna Kids is chewable.  Straight forward and done.  Definitely a huge believer in this product.  I do not give Luna Kids to my children very often. I think only a handful of times.  I'd much rather they develop coping skills to figure out how to get to sleep.

After doing some research and talking with friends who also have children with the same problems, decided to give a natural sleep aid a try. I chose Luna because of its minimal dose for kids and it is chewable. We've been given it to him for a few weeks now, and I have noticed that he is sleeping more soundly and through the night. His moods have improved because he's not tired and cranky. It does take about 30 minutes to kick in and I am following the recommendations of no screen time about 45 minutes before bed time.  His only complaint is the taste, he eats it but makes  a face the entire time and says it's yucky. However, he's also very picky and I tasted one myself and it wasn't that bad. So, the reduction in stars has to do with the fact that there aren't other flavors available. I think he'd be more open to it if it were a berry flavor instead of a tropical fruit flavor. *I was given this product for free with an honest review.",4,"notice soon year old experience strange sleep cycle affect day school attitude moody etc research talk friends also children problems decide give natural sleep aid try choose luna minimal dose kid chewable give weeks notice sleep soundly night moods improve tire cranky take minutes kick follow recommendations screen time minutes bed time complaint taste eat make face entire time say yucky however also picky taste one bad reduction star fact flavor available think open berry flavor instead tropical fruit flavor give product free honest review"

Hitting, kicking, screaming. As she got older it has most definitely gotten a lot better (OT helped) but she still has a hard time calming down and falling asleep. I wanted something safe and having read the reviews thought I would give Luna a try. Since many of the reviews stated they didn't give their child a full pill, I started with 1/4 and she was able to settle down and within an hour to hour and half she would fall asleep. I've since upped the dosage to half a pill and she would fall asleep within 45mins to an hour. She wakes up happy, not groggy or cranky as some other sleep aids.

It continues on a cycle and makes bedtimes so hard. A friend recommended melatonin. She uses a competitors product. I researched online and liked that luna had less melatonin and used other herbs. So I decided to give them a shot. I had no idea what to expect that first night. I gave it to them in the bath around 1930 at night. By 2030- both girls were fast asleep. This has never happened before except after spending a day at Disneyland. It has helped so much. They are able to go to bed at reasonable times and be awake for school.

I have a four year old who has a difficult time sleeping-- always has. On particularly difficult nights we might give him a little melatonin. In the past I have bought 1mg tabs and given him a quarter-- this tiny amount workedjust fine. We had recently run out of the 1mg variety and while looking to replenish our supply, I came across LUNA. I was immediately drawn by the fact that it  had such a small dose of melatonin and I was intrigued by the use of other herbs to promote calm and sleep. It has not been a disappointment. Luna works fantastically!  We use it sparingly, but it does the trick on those nights where there is no other way to bring soothing calm to my son. My six year old also tried it on a camping trip (he was too excited to sleep) and it worked great for him, as well, although he found the taste peculiar (the stevia is definitely a different sweet). Most surprising, however, is that my husband loves Luna!  He is a massive insomniac and cannot keep a consistent sleep schedule. Regular adult melatonin knocks him out, but it also makes him groggy in the morning. He said that Luna provides this gentle nudge towards sleep without forcing it.",5,"update one year later still love luna four year old difficult time sleep always particularly difficult nights might give little melatonin past buy mg tabs give quarter tiny amount workedjust fine recently run mg variety look replenish supply come across luna immediately draw fact small dose melatonin intrigue use herbs promote calm sleep disappointment luna work fantastically use sparingly trick nights way bring soothe calm son six year old also try camp trip excite sleep work great well although find taste peculiar stevia definitely different sweet surprise however husband love luna massive insomniac cannot keep consistent sleep schedule regular adult melatonin knock also make groggy morning say luna provide gentle nudge towards sleep without force"

Anytime I had a thought, it drifted away. However.....one night I was worried about something, very briefly. It was also more of a negative emotion/feeling I had which was due to my own thinking. But then as I fell asleep, I had a very terrible horrific nightmare. The nightmare felt like a bad LSD trip. What's funny is, I don't usually have nightmares but when I do, they aren't that scary. I know it was from this and tied to my negative emotion before bed. I would not recommend this especially for children.

But despite that, he never had sleeping issues.  Once he was sleep he was out for a good 10 hours.  And going to sleep wasnt a problem.  After snuggling up in his favorite blankets, within a few minutes he'd be sleep.  That is until he started the medicine to help manage his ADHD symptoms.  Then he had problems going to sleep right away.  And even when he did, he only slept for no more than 8 hours.  His pediatrician prescribed benadryl for him to take at night.  Well, yes it helped him get to sleep and stay, but then the wake up process was a nightmare because he would be tired and drag as an after effect.  So I started looking for something more natural.  Tried melatonin at first,  which was helpful, but didn't help him get to sleep in a timely manner.  Then I came across Luna.  So far it has proven to be an answer to my prayers.  I can give it to him.  He'll take it with no problem.  And after about 1/2 or so he winds down and I get him ready for bed.  In no later than 10 minutes he's sleep and good for a solid 10 hours.  And wake up has been without the mental drag he received when using benadryl.  Momma's a happy camper!

With Luna she seems to naturally want to go to bed which is the first time she ever said she was tired and wanted to go to bed. I feel better with Luna and I am excited to see how the rest of the bottle goes. I love that Luna is 0.2 mgs and all natural extracts. I can finally feel like I'm giving her a safe solution. Also tired teddies are more expensive than Luna! I definitely recommend Luna Kids! The only thing is the flavor. My daughter would beg for tired teddies because of the bubble gum flavor. She doesn't hate Luna flavor but she still asks for tired teddies because she enjoyed the flavor more. Maybe Luna will have new flavors soon! Edit: So I wrote a review the other day. It's been a couple nights since my daughter has started taking these pills. I am no longer giving them to her because she has been having dreams that wake her up in a panic. With the tired teddies she has not had this problem so I decided on not giving them to her anymore.

"1274541","B00U470TAK","Luna Kids | #1 Sleep Aid Tablets for Children & Sensitive Adults | Naturally Sourced Ingredients | Chewable Pills | Gentle Herbal Supplement with Chamomile, Melatonin, Valerian & Lemon Balm","Since our oldest daughter (now 8 years old) was a baby she has had a really tough time to fall asleep. Once she felt asleep she was and still is fine. Occasionally she wakes up in the night but is able to fall asleep fast then. Over the years we tried almost everything to make going to bed easier, acceptable and enjoyable to her. We worked close with our pediatrician, tried alternative healing methods, visited special yoga classes for kids, banished sugar from our life after 5pm, watching TV only at the weekend, experienced autogenous training, having a great bedtime routine.... But honestly we haven't been successful. Over the years our daughter got more and more uncomfortable with her situation - she, no the entire family was frustrated, exhausted and we all felt helpless. Especially for me as her mother the situation was terrible. It was hard to bear to see how much she suffered and I couldn't help her.  There was no way to get out of this vicious cycle of laying for hours in bed and don't fall asleep, not getting enough sleep, being tired, unconcentrated over the day and feeling always unbalanced and although she was tired the next evening and wanted to go to bed she couldn't fall asleep again and needed 1 1/2  - 2hours to do so. At this point we thought we have to deal with this stuation somehow and we all tried to accept this unsatisfactory situation. And then came LUNA Kids to our life.  These small, chewable and because of that easy to take tablets with its kids friendly taste changed our, especially our daughters, life (hopefully for ever). If I would have known that our situation could be changed that easily.... But I don't want to complain. I'm so happy that we finally found a way that our daughter falls asleep easily and fast. LUNA Kids worked immediately! She took her first tablet about 30 min before her bed time and she felt asleep this night after only 45 min! What a success! We have been so glad. In the meanwhile we adjusted the time when she takes her tablet. If she takes the tablet around an hour before her bedtime we do have the greatest advantage because she sleeps after only 10-15 minutes e v e r y night!! Also our days totally changed: she is much more balanced, her mood is happier, she's more powerful and she even looks healthier (no more dark circles under her eyes) and she is smiling and laughing the entire day! It looks that she feels comfortable with her life. LUNA Kids will be from now on our daily companion. Because of our great experience with LUNA Kids we highly recommand them to everyone who has kids with problems falling asleep.",5,"since oldest daughter years old baby really tough time fall asleep felt asleep still fine occasionally wake night able fall asleep fast years try almost everything make go bed easier acceptable enjoyable work close pediatrician try alternative heal methods visit special yoga class kid banish sugar life pm watch tv weekend experience autogenous train great bedtime routine honestly successful years daughter get uncomfortable situation entire family frustrate exhaust felt helpless especially mother situation terrible hard bear see much suffer help way get vicious cycle lay hours bed fall asleep get enough sleep tire unconcentrated day feel always unbalance although tire next even want go bed fall asleep need hours point think deal stuation somehow try accept unsatisfactory situation come luna kid life small chewable easy take tablets kid friendly taste change especially daughters life hopefully ever would know situation could change easily want complain happy finally find way daughter fall asleep easily fast luna kid work immediately take first tablet min bed time felt asleep night min success glad meanwhile adjust time take tablet take tablet around hour bedtime greatest advantage sleep minutes e v e r night also days totally change much balance mood happier powerful even look healthier dark circle eye smile laugh entire day look feel comfortable life luna kid daily companion great experience luna kid highly recommand everyone kid problems fall asleep"

We were struggling with our 2, almost 3 year old daughter and her sleep schedule. She never fought bedtime or even got out of her big girl bed, but she would sing/talk to herself and play with her stuffed animals for up to an hour past her schedule bedtime of 8:30pm. Because of this,she was getting an hour less of sleep and actually waking up earlier because of it (usually 5-5:30am). You know what they say, sleep begets sleep. So along with cutting her daytime naps down from 2hours to 1 1/2 hours, we started using Luna to help her get to sleep when she should. The first night we used it, it was very obvious that she was getting very sleepy. Amazing to 'see' this product work. We have been using for a couple of weeks now and seem to have finally found a more appropriate sleep schedule. We give her the ""night time vitamin"" around 8 each night for her 8:30 bed time. It is very clear that it helps her wind down and feel tired. She gladly gets in her bed and even asked to be put to bed one night. She sleeps until 6:30am now which is when we need her up by to get off to work. One note I would add is to not give to your LO too far before bed time. I gave it to her at 7:45 one night and come 8:30, she was falling apart. I think she felt overly sleepy by that point which translates to cranky/whiny.  I have tried so many things to get on this schedule but this finally did it. I also really love that it's natural with just a tiny bit of melatonin. I recommended to my sister in law for her 5yo that was waking up at 4am lately and she's also had success. Hope this review helps someone because the previous ones really helped me, just like this product!!!",5,"add review review really helpful struggle almost year old daughter sleep schedule never fight bedtime even get big girl bed would sing talk play stuff animals hour past schedule bedtime pm get hour less sleep actually wake earlier usually know say sleep beget sleep along cut daytime nap hours hours start use luna help get sleep first night use obvious get sleepy amaze see product work use couple weeks seem finally find appropriate sleep schedule give night time vitamin around night bed time clear help wind feel tire gladly get bed even ask put bed one night sleep need get work one note would add give lo far bed time give one night come fall apart think felt overly sleepy point translate cranky whiny try many things get schedule finally also really love natural tiny bite melatonin recommend sister law yo wake lately also success hope review help someone previous ones really help like product"

It seemed like once she was asleep, she was fine, but she couldn't easily wind her mind down to fall asleep to begin with. We had tried every trick in the book, but nothing was working. It was affecting her ability to learn at pre-school as she was generally only getting about 6 hours of sleep. Her mood was also deteriorating as this lack of sleep persisted. I talked to her pediatrician, who suggested I try melatonin. I knew from reviews of liquid melatonin that getting my girl to take a ""yucky"" syrup wouldn't be successful, so I tried Luna. I started her with one chewable tablet per night and it worked immediately. Her whole life changed. She's sleeping 10.5-11 hours per night. She has great reports from school. Her mood is happier. I cannot say enough about how great this product has been for us.  In fact, when I saw how well it was working, I thought I would decrease the dose to see if that could work, because like any mother, I want my child to have as few medicinal or herbal interventions as possible.  She only needs a half tablet to experience the full benefits of this supplement. By the way, at either dose I have tried, there seem to be no adverse effects in the morning.

Finally, after 4 years of not sleeping, we came across Luna Kids tabs and decided to give them a shot. I wasn't really keen on using melatonin--I know it can cause dependency, and cause severe grogginess in the morning. But since the amount of melatonin was so low, I didn't think it would be a problem. The first night we used them, my son fell asleep right away. He was still up at 5am, but he got a good solid 9 hours of sleep. These have been a godsend. My nearly 8 year old also asks for them when she's having a hard time falling asleep.

I was really skeptical about this product because we tried everything to help our 5 year old fall asleep at night and no matter what, it's a battle, and he's been that way since he was a baby. His little sister goes to sleep pretty easily, so I couldn't understand what it was we were doing wrong with our son. He is scared of the dark and would scream (and I really mean SCREAM) if we turned off the lights, or even just had a little night light. He would even tell us that he wasn't tired so we wouldn't put him to bed, even though it was so obvious he was rubbing his eyes, drowsy and over tired. We were telling our neighbors about our problem, and the mom told us that she gives these to her 12 year old son for his anxiety before bedtime. I didn't even realize that what my son was experiencing was a severe amount of anxiety before bedtime. Still skeptical, I ordered these anyway because it couldn't hurt to spend a few dollars after already spending so much on other things like essential oils, bath salts, sleepy time bath soaps, even a sleepy time sound track. Now before we ordered it, we had already started working on a more consistent bedtime routine, and letting him know throughout the day when we'd be going to bed and what things we need to do before we go to bed and sleep. Things like ""when we get home, we'll have dinner, clean up the toys, take a shower, and brush our teeth before bed"" so that he knew what to expect when we'd get home. We gave him 1 pill a half hour before bedtime and I really couldn't believe how much more relaxed he was about going to bed! He still tried to fight it, but with much less kicking and screaming. Once in bed, we read books, say prayers and he falls asleep so peacefully now. I can happily say it's been 3 weeks of peaceful bedtimes that I never dreamed we would have! *****TL;DR version: 1. To make the most out of this product, I highly recommend having a solid bedtime routine and managing your child's expectations by letting him/her know throughout the day when bedtime is and what will happen before going to bed. Establishing a routine has now helped him associate these events with sleep. 2. Give this to your child early enough. Giving it to our son too late when he's already over tired doesn't seem to help very much, and takes him much longer to fall asleep than if we give it to him a half hour before he should be in bed. 3. Your child may not like the taste of these.

After months of research and agonizing I found Luna on Amazon.  The more I looked the more I loved it.  It isn't a straight melatonin product, utilizing other calming herbs etc to help ease and relax so that falling asleep is easy and just enough melatonin to help stay asleep and wake up refreshed.

Now in 2020 my kiddos are older and we still use Luna.  They're easy to chew and while you may get a tart one every now and then they're great tasting.

Apparently it tastes (to her) a bit like ""herbal tea"" - Sleep is peaceful and calm, and importantly, predictable. Sleep arrives without fuss and fanfare in 60 minutes. Before Luna Kids, bedtime could stretch for hours (not kidding). Now, we do the same things, but our child falls gently asleep through our bedtime routine consistently within 60 minutes of taking Luna Kids and starting our bedtime routine.

But I hope this helps someone else who’s struggling as we did!! Putting one of our 6yr old twins to bed has been a HUGE struggle since he was 2yr old. He’d go through phases where he’d be up out of bed 100 times before finally going to sleep somewhere between 12-2am then he’d go through phases where he’d be “a good boy” and stay in bed but be awake until the same hours. We’d tried Bribing and begging and pleading and enforceing negative consequences in hopes that he’d make a connection. Nothing worked!  I truly felt bad for him. After consulting with his Ped (a number of times) we were told “it’s just a phase” and to try things like limiting electronics, wear orange safety glasses for an hour before bed, lavender and other oils and  melatonin. ALL of these things would work for a few days. We finally got to the point where my son was begging me to help him go to sleep. I was at a loss and truly felt horrible about it. He’d say things like “my brain won’t let me go to sleep” “my brain won’t turn off”. He walked around with bags under his eyes most of the time. Needless to say we have behavior issues from the lack of sleep. One day my best friend mentioned that her daughter ( with a similar problem) started taking Luna Kids. She said that she couldn’t believe it was actually working. I was super skeptical but  desperate so I ordered a bottle. OH MY GOSH!

Could they really do what they claimed to do? I have a son with ADHD, combined type, and generalized anxiety, who has a terrible time getting to sleep at night. He does take a very mild medication to assist him in getting to sleep, but it's just not enough. The medicine helps him get to sleep, but not stay asleep throughout the night.  So we searched online to find something natural that might help him get a good night's sleep when we found these on Amazon. The reviews looked good enough. However, we couldn't find anything mentioning how these chewables tasted or how big they were. My son is very picky, and he has an aversion to the taste of most vitamins, so that was a big concern for us. We found out that the flavor was ""tropical berry"", and luckily, my son agreed to at least try them, thinking he could swallow them if he didn't like the  taste and if they were small enough. We bought them, figuring we'd give them a try as we were pretty desperate to find something to help him. So really, what did we have to lose? They came speedy fast and immediately after receiving them, we had our son try them out before bed. The first night they made my son a little sleepier than usual which was nice, but we hadn't gotten the full effect just yet, as it takes a few days to weeks for that to happen. We're now a few weeks out and it works like magic. We give it to him right before bed, and he is now getting a full night's rest. He's even sleeping in, which is so unusual for him. He's always been the kid up before us around 5:30 - 6:00 am in the morning. This supplement has been great for us. Another plus is my son is sleeping so well, he's sleeping in his own bed now without coming into our bed in the middle of the night. I'm so glad we gave these a try. One negative is my son is not crazy about the taste of the chewables. He thinks they're too sour (which sounds good to me) so he chews it fast and swallows it partially whole as it's small enough (see my picture). He's still getting the full effects though, and I am happy that their natural and that they don't interact with the medicine he already takes.

Melatonin alone helped her and my son fall asleep, but they would wake up almost exactly 4 hours later. Fast forward several years and I finally found Luna for kids. It doesn't ""knock them out"" like melatonin alone. It gently assists them into falling asleep and helps then stay asleep. We do have to take breaks (weekends and sometimes a month break) because they do become adjusted to the supplements after awhile. However, this is to be expected with a supplement like this.

Bedtime is less than one hour, she doesn't wake up an hour later and she is getting at least 10.5 + hours of solid sleep. She is even a more pleasant child during the day, bonus for that.

My 8 year old daughter has always had trouble falling asleep.  It is common that it takes 2 hours in bed before she finally falls asleep on her own.  About a year and a half ago she stared having anxiety on top of her sleep problem so I decided to try melatonin.  I was giving her a half dose of vitafusion SleepWell gummies, which was about 1.5mg.  They worked wonderfully for her falling asleep...most nights it took only 15 minutes for her to become very sleepy and go right to bed and fall asleep.  During this time though her anxiety increased and her personality changed to an extremely negative thinking person who was lashing out.  I continued use of the vitafusion gummies for 6 months before my research lead me to stop giving her the melatonin.  Within one to two weeks of discontinuing the vitafusion melatonin gummies her negitivity almost entirely went away and she was acting like her old self.  But we were back to the issue of her not being able to sleep.  From there I tried Natural Vitality Calm, essential oils, coffea cruda, a weighted blanket, accupressure, and more.  None of them helped her fall asleep any sooner.  I was at my wits end!  Then I found this product, LUNA KIDS NATURAL SLEEP AID.  I was very hesitant to buy it at first.  I had searched for months for any other natural alternative and could find nothing that either I hadn't already tried or that didn't have melatonin.  This product however stated that it only had 0.2mg of melatonin in it.  Significantly less then what we had tried before.  I decided to try it, knowing this time what signs to look for and knowing I could stop if I saw her personality changing again.  The day we got it I gave her only a half a pill that night.  She told me she was tired within an hour of taking it and we put her into bed and she was asleep in only 20 or so minutes after that.  I tried a quarter of a pill the next night and it didn't seem to help.  I went back to a half pill the next night and we were happy to find the same result as the first night.  Tired/sleepy an hour after taking it and asleep in under half hour.  This was exciting for us!  I waited until we had used this for 3 weeks before leaving a review because I wanted to see if it effected her behavior or mood and I am more than happy to report that it hasn't!  I am so relieved to have found this product and that it says it is safe to use long term.

"1274906","B00U470TAK","Luna Kids | #1 Sleep Aid Tablets for Children & Sensitive Adults | Naturally Sourced Ingredients | Chewable Pills | Gentle Herbal Supplement with Chamomile, Melatonin, Valerian & Lemon Balm","Why I bought this: My daughter has had a problem falling asleep lately.  No matter what the routine is she just won't fall asleep until around ten pm and then wakes up super grumpy in the mornings and pretty much all day.  She comes home from school with a tummy ache every day and says it is because she did not get enough sleep.  She has had difficulty being distracted at school and finishing her work (I'm assuming because she is tired).  The first two nights she took this it was a breeze putting her to bed and she fell asleep by 8pm.  Last night was the first night she did not take it and I really wish she had, the morning routine was rough. Taste: Out of my three kids two ate it just fine with no comment on the taste.  One of them is not crazy about it and it takes some coercing, quick chewing and a swig of water to get it down.  I tasted it and it isn't that bad, a mild berry flavor.  I would give it five stars if all of my kids liked the taste. Overall:  It is a great product.  I love that it is portioned safely for kids, and it really does help my kids fall asleep easier. My experience has been that after giving kids anything with melatonin you really have to have them in bed with the lights out within 20 minutes or they REALLY have a melt down and it just makes getting through the bedtime routine harder.  I also added a foot massage to the bedtime routine with essential oils (diluted Peaceful Sleep essential oil by Now) and Magnesium Oil with Aloe Vera by Raise Them Well.  The combination of the three products has really made a difference in my daughters sleep cycles and attitude.

My daughter starting taking Luna at night time when she was 7 years old and is now 9. Luna saved us! For so long my little girl would have such a hard time falling asleep at bedtime and would have to wake up for school each morning feeling tired and cranky because she wasn't getting the proper amount of sleep she needed each night. I read the reviews for this product noticing that mostly each customer that had purchased these was happy with the product. Getting the proper amount of sleep each night is important for learning and focusing well in school. It's also important for her mood to have proper sleep. With this product you cannot go wrong! You get a 100% money back guarantee for a lifetime if you buy these and to me that was important as well. I wondered if they would work for my daughter and purchased them in hopes they would. We got them in the mail and tried one the first night we got them. They are chewable and taste like ""smarties"" candy, according to my little girl. I tried one myself as well. We both took one together that night and then went to lay down and relax while watching tv. Within a good 45 minutes my daughter was asleep at 8pm. Luna was able to help me relax and go to bed earlier then I usually do as well. That was the first time in so long that she fell asleep at a decent hour on a school night. I was sooooo happy! The next morning she woke up in a good mood and was singing and happy while getting ready for school. I am one happy mommy with this product and highly recommend you at least give it a try if your child has a hard time falling asleep at night. It cost a lot more than I wanted to pay, but my daughter getting the proper amount of sleep each night is so important and it has been worth every penny. My daughter goes to bed at 8pm each night and has to wake up at 630am to get ready for the bus that picks her up at 7:10am. That 10 hours of sleep is what my daughter needs right now and it has really made a huge difference in her mood during the day. There are much less temper tantrums being thrown and she is just all around much happier. Another wonderful benefit is that the ingredients are also all natural.

I needed more ""me"" time at the end of the day, more time to actually have a convo with my husband, and possibly watch a bit of t.v. Luna Sleep Aid has gently nudged my kids to a much faster bedtime process, helping them to actually fall asleep soon after being tucked in (the 1st time, not the 4th). So far I'm very happy with the results.  I don't put them to bed super early or anything. The process usually begins at 8:30 but the actual sleep part is closer to 9 or later. I have noticed that after they take their sleep candy, they wake up earlier the next morning then when they aren't taking the pill the night before. But that's totally fine. I figure it's a result of getting their sleep cycles on a better track. They also enjoy the taste. I have now recommended this product to a friend who intends to try it on her kids as well. I have no complaints!

We tried Children's Luna and I cannot tell you how this stuff has turned her life around! She falls asleep easily, sleeps through the night and wakes up on her own feeling refreshed and in a good mood. Before discovering Luna, she was drowsy and depressed during class. She had a difficult time focusing on her school work. Her teacher now says she is more alert in class and is able to focus better.  I guess that's what happens when a child actually gets a good night's rest! We had anticipated the Luna helping with her sleep but an added bonus had been her stomach issues were resolved.

Recently I decided to take the plunge to see if it made any difference with her sleep and let me tell you, it DOES. It works!! The tab dissolves or you can chew it (she prefers to let it dissolve) and she usually takes it 1/2 hour before bed or even at bedtime (since she reads before going to sleep). Since taking this, she falls asleep and stays asleep until the morning (where as she used to take up to an hour to fall asleep and would wake anywhere from 1-3x a night. Because I am fearful of addiction and affecting her melatonin levels as she gets older, we will not use this every night, all the time, etc. She used it for a week and then we took a night off (she was up 3x that night).

In the past she's used melatonin alone and has what we refer to as ""melatonin meltdowns.""  While this has melatonin in it, it's a very small dose so we're not having the same meltdowns, in fact with the addition of the other ingredients we have a calm bedtime routine.  Since using this over the last few months my daughter has seen a sleep specialist and is being worked up for narcolepsy.  So this medication alone doesn't put her to sleep, but it says in it's description it's an aid, but there is now another factor working against us.  It definitely helps calm her, and I believe if we didn't have this possible narcolepsy diagnosis it would put her to sleep much faster.  I would definitely recommend it, though, and we've been advised to keep using it to help facilitate sleep.  I would recommend it for the fact that it helps her wind down and keeps her calm.  I was wary buying this at first because if you've ever dealt with a melatonin meltdown you would want to avoid it at all costs, but again, the chamomile and other ingredients balance that out.  I also like it's specifically formulated for children, as opposed to other medications you can buy at the nutrition store that are natural but not necessarily formulated for children.

He couldn't even lay still for a minute to try to sleep very active and his mind would think about everything else, but sleep. Well we tried everything hot milk warm baths with essential oils and it helped a bit, he would lay in bed but, still would play in bed all hours of the night. We tried a doctor because he was getting no sleep and he gave him a sleeping pills that were not suppose to be addicting, well they were! My husband and I pulled him off of the sleeping pills and fired our child's doctor. We tried the nighty night tea that are all natural for children and my son loved the taste and sometimes he would fall a sleep and sometimes he couldn't . But still gave him the tea faithfully and warm bath with essential oils, and we would read him a bed time story. Because thats all i knew how to help him. But he would still sleep walk and talk in his sleep constantly, you could even tell him you love him when he was sleeping for hours and he would tell me love you too mommy . No deep sleep there!! Well, he would wake up every morning cranky and most of the time he had huge meltdowns, we homeschool and he couldn't learn because he was so sleepy and when we would take him anywhere he would want to fall asleep if he had to sit still for a few minutes, it was impossible and a losing battle. I know they say melatonin is safe and natural because our bodies make it but I was still worried about the store's brand and  about giving him a adult form because that's all you can find at the store. So I got onto amazon, looking for children natural sleeping aid and read the reviews and checking into the ingredients, because of ADHD i don't give him sugar, dyes, etc. so after a few weeks I decided to give it a Luna kids a try shipping was very fast. The first night i gave it to him, he wasn't crazy about the taste at first, but he kept chewing it and said it was good after you got use to it and he generally takes him about  1 hour to fall a sleep after taking it. No more sleep walking and the sleep talking and rolling all over the bed, and best of all he doesn't answer me when i ask him a question in his sleep ....he's sleeping good now and he wakes up on his own now no more pulling him out of the bed every morning. He's happy and calm luna doesn't seem to bother his stomach either usually everything seems to upset his stomach and he's not groggy the next day.

I wanted to find the lowest dose possible to give my child and Luna seems to be the best one I could find.  My child WANTS to take it because it helps them get to sleep better, quicker.  I don't have to ask my child to take it, even though my child says it tastes bad. My child is ten so can swallow the tablet rather than chew it so that helps.  Despite my child complaining of the taste, they are still ready to take it, on their own every night, so my child is finding their own value in Luna.  Since starting the Luna, my child has been reporting dreams to me every morning, not bad dreams, mostly good dreams.  My child rarely reported dreams before so I wonder if they are getting more/better sleep with the Luna so they are able to dream now???

The regular Luna sleep aid had very high dosages, and ingredients that I wasn't comfortable taking since I still breastfeed my 2-year-old. This Kids version DOES seem to be helping my sleep. I was in an awful rut of having a hard time falling asleep, and waking many times during the night. I take two tablets about an hour before bedtime and I am definitely more sleepy than usual. Not like a drugged feeling, but just really ready to lay down and sleep. I am consistently getting a 4 hour block of uninterrupted sleep - which is a lot better than before. I do keep waking up around that point for a few minutes, but it's not too hard to get back to sleep for another few hours (though those are more broken than I'd like).

I was beyond pleased to find this sleeping tablet with just the right mix of valerian root (and enhanced by the lemon balm!) and melatonin. I have heard melatonin can be iffy in boys, so i believe the ratio presented in this tablet is the reason for its great success. He was out in 30 minutes exactly on his first try!

She kept telling us she could not fall asleep, and she indeed could NOT! Sometimes she would still be awake 3 hours after we put her to bed... She was often tired during the day and it really became a big concern for us. After endless months of this I talked to my pediatrician and asked for help, I was desperate! She recommended melatonin, a sleep hormone, but I wanted to look for the most natural option I could find, and in my research I came across LUNA Kids, I liked the fact that the melatonin dose was minimal and all the remaining ingredients were totally natural and known for their calming effects, such as: chamomile, valerian root, Lemon balm, etc. So I decided to try it and OH BOY! It completely changed our lives and our night routine!!!!! Taken half hour before bed time, it works WONDERS!

During the school years there are nights some of the kids just cant sleep so I want something I can have available. Luna Kids has so far turned out to be just that. The dosage is for 4 and up, my kids are 5, 7, 11, 13, and 14. For the younger 2 I did split the dosage and it worked like a charm. They took their dosage and after about 30 minutes they were both asleep. They did sleep well and through the night, they normally do anyways but they have trouble trying to relax enough to actually go to sleep. Luna Kids helped with that. My middle son, 13, tried a regular, required dosage as well the following night and he was able to relax and sleep throughout the night. He has always had issues with sleep and we have not found anything so far that works for him. He can stay up super late and then be the first one up in the mornings, which I know he can not do once he is back in school in the fall.

Bedtime was such a battle every night, it seemed like the minute we say its time to get ready for bed our kids would get out their energy reserves and be bouncing off the walls. I have tried everything under the sun from strict bedtime routines, baths, bedtime books, essential oils, tea, etc. If it was natural I tried it. But nothing was really doing the trick and I was exhausted. I was staying up later and later just to squeeze in some ""me time"" and my husband and I didn't get any alone time unless he would wake up at 2-3 am to be up with me. Always feeling exhausted from lack of sleep myself the bedtime battles became more draining as you could imagine. I ran across this product and had read through tons of the reviews. Even though there was many that swore by it, I secretly thought to myself ""it will never work with my kids, nothing does"" but I was so desperate I decided to try it. I did receive a promotional code to get this at a lower price, which to be honest was the only way I would have ever tried it. Our 2 year old is big for her age, she weighs 32 lbs and is tall but since it says that it is for 4 years and up I had only used it on our 4 year old the first night. He did his typical running around crazy energy stuff but within 30 minutes he was out like a light. I was convinced it was a coincidence and that the Luna kids had nothing to do with it. So the second night I gave it to him again (I also made sure to just tell him it was a vitamin because I didn't want him knowing it would help with sleep, fearing it would not make it work) 30 minutes or so later, out like a light. Yet again, I still just could not believe he was asleep by 8 pm. I was still having to deal with the 2 year old being up late and seen that others had given this to children younger than 4. Not being fully convinced I continued for 3 more nights with the 4 year old and it was still working, being that my 2 year old is only a few pounds less than my 4 year old, regular medicine is based on weight, and the other reviews saying they had tried with younger kids I decided I would give her 1/2 tablet just to see. These chewable tablets have .2 mg of melatonin but besides that are very natural. Technically melatonin is natural also since our bodies make it anyway, but I don't need to get into detail with that. .2 mg of melatonin is such a very very small amount and I took Melatonin when I was in high school to help me get to sleep easier so I am familiar with it and not concerned to give them such a small dose. Prior to being a stay at home mom I had worked in nursing for 8 years also. I was still skeptical before trying this on my 2 year old but I had nothing to lose and could feel my nighttime sanity starting to come back. So I started by giving her 1/2 tablet and withing an hour she was sleeping. I continued with 1/2 tablet and it would vary how long it took her to fall asleep but it was usually an hour or less. The tablets are not scored to be cut in half so I was just cutting them with a knife and I assume being that way she may have not been getting an equal amount of the ingredients with each 1/2 tablet. I started to give her a full tablet after a few nights of the 1/2 dose just to make sure she seemed to do ok with the ingredients. 1 tablet works much better and within about 30 minutes she falls asleep as well. We are still on our first bottle but I am totally and 100% convinced this is an amazing product and it really does work. It has been such a lifesaver in our home and I am so happy that I have found it. I have been spreading the word to all of my mom friends and will definitely be purchasing this again and again.",5,"happy decide try product kid stay home mom amaze energetic bundle joy age bedtime battle every night seem like minute say time get ready bed kid would get energy reserve bounce wall try everything sun strict bedtime routines bath bedtime book essential oil tea etc natural try nothing really trick exhaust stay later later squeeze time husband get alone time unless would wake always feel exhaust lack sleep bedtime battle become drain could imagine run across product read tons review even though many swear secretly think never work kid nothing desperate decide try receive promotional code get lower price honest way would ever try year old big age weigh lbs tall since say years use year old first night typical run around crazy energy stuff within minutes like light convince coincidence luna kid nothing second night give also make sure tell vitamin want know would help sleep fear would make work minutes later like light yet still could believe asleep pm still deal year old late see others give children younger fully convince continue nights year old still work year old pound less year old regular medicine base weight review say try younger kid decide would give tablet see chewable tablets mg melatonin besides natural technically melatonin natural also since body make anyway need get detail mg melatonin small amount take melatonin high school help get sleep easier familiar concern give small dose prior stay home mom work nurse years also still skeptical try year old nothing lose could feel nighttime sanity start come back start give tablet withing hour sleep continue tablet would vary long take fall asleep usually hour less tablets score cut half cut knife assume way may get equal amount ingredients tablet start give full tablet nights dose make sure seem ok ingredients tablet work much better within minutes fall asleep well still first bottle totally convince amaze product really work lifesaver home happy find spread word mom friends definitely purchase"

It worked like magic.He was asleep with in a half hour of taking half the pill. He's usually up multiple times in a night he only woke up 1x.  It was much needed sleep for the both of us. However the 2nd night I gave him the other half of the pill. Again asleep with in 30 mins but this time he woke up screaming his lungs off. I ran into the room but he was still sleeping but screaming. I tried to wake him up and I couldn't. It was like he was stuck in a nightmare and couldn't get out. He started screaming for me and all i could do was cry and try to get him to wake up. He was in a trance. I started screaming his name shaking him but nothing. I ran to get him some water and a cold dampen cloth. He's  still screaming while im doing this. I put the cloth on him and tried to get him to drink the water all at the same time saying baby wake up mommy is here, please just wake up. Eventually i just threw the cup of water on him. He didnt jump out of the dream but he did open his eyes. It was like he was in a trance or sleep walking. I then started to slap his face a little and tried getting him to stand on his feet. Eventually he did get up and he stopped screaming.  Unfortunately it wasnt over. Once he was ready to go back to sleep he couldnt get settle. Or he would dose off and start screaming again as if the nightmare started again. He ended up not being able to go back to bed and i never went to bed at all. It was one of the most scariest nights of my life I refuse to give it to him ever again. I cant relive that again or put him through that ever. So he only used 1 pill in total and the bottle is just sitting in the Medicine cabinet.

While there are no cures for Alzheimers, they do find that toxins and inflammation do the damage that can result in this frightening disease that is so hard on families.  Having too many ""brain farts"" to ignore, I set out to do what I could -- on multiple fronts. So when I looked for supplements I could trust, I knew I wanted a brand that was very conscientious in the sources of their ingredients, with the strength I needed, and at a price I could still afford.  I'm so happy to have found a review of supplements that put Naturelo at the top, and then to find they have a very full line of products. Sleep is just one of the many products I now order regularly.  It's an important one because getting enough sleep is my biggest weakness.  Even when I miss taking the whole handful of pills I set up to take daily, I do not ever miss taking Sleep, as well as the Naturelo Vitamin D3 (to counter Osteoporosis). I find that even if I don't think I'm ready for bed, the effect of Sleep, taken a half hour before laying down, is that I easily relax -- without any grogginess -- and I'm out.

Two entries: Still Tuesday, April 03, 2018, 1230 So picking up where I left off this morning… It was right after the first of ’11 that I got an on-going prescription for Ambien/Zolpidem. I’m going to be generous as hell and say that has given me six hours of sleep a night. So from ’05 – ’11 was six more years of “normal” as I had previously written. That’s 52 “extra days” per year time six more years which equals 300 days, or, another year. So that’s now 04 years added to my life. 07 years of 06 hours sleep per night = 02 hours “extra time” x 365 days/year = 730 hours ÷ 30 days x 07 years = 210 days which, again, because I am being generous, is one more year added to my life. That’s 05 years “extra” I have lived by simply not sleeping. So I am sitting here at almost 66 years old. That makes me 71 in terms of being “awake”. Still Sunday, April 07, 2019, 1344 Let’s play a game, shall we? As of today, there are 6,141 entries in my daily, chronological journals.

I’d paged through product after product reading every ingredient and suddenly I landed on the product called Luna. I was surprised with it’s “all natural” ingredients and being melatonin free. I use melatonin but it alone wasn’t helping. I didn’t want anything else with that ingredient because you can’t take more or less, you’re stuck with what’s included with “most” natural sleep aids that truthfully are extremely costly from a health food store. I also know through years of attempting to buy OTC supplements for sleep that every single one contains a pain releaver and/or an allergy relief. I had neither, so why take that, and honestly that’s all that’s in them including a very high price. I read the reviews and especially the ingredients and decided I had nothing to lose so I ordered it. Let me say, I was so surprised the very first night! I took the recommended 2 capsules and actually was relaxed enough that the next thing I knew it was 4 hours later. I woke up and within minutes (I think) I was asleep again, and the next thing that woke me was my alarm 6 hours later. I couldn’t believe how much better I felt and without any grogginess the whole day. I was instantly hooked and on what...sleep! I continued the 2 capsules nightly for months because truthfully I was afraid without Luna I might not rest and sleep. Night after night, sweet sleep and I can’t tell you how much better I felt. About a few months in, i thought I’d try just one capsule each night, and I’m still taking that 1 single capsule because it’s so helpful in relaxing myself to comfortably falling asleep. I know I definitely needed the full dose of 2 in the beginning, but now half the dose if I’m feeling restless works great. I’ll continue to order Luna every 2 months and if I’m having trouble falling asleep I know I always have a bottle on hand. Without discovering Luna, well, I don’t even think about it.

I generally sleep 8 hours per night and was unaware of any sleep problems. However, my sleep was frequently interrupted by bathroom visits, 1 to 3 per night and my heart rate dip was low, light sleep most common, deep sleep rare. I made a number of changes, including adding a blackout curtain for the one window in my bedroom, turning off my computer at night, taking Luna sleep aid before rest, quitting all caffeinated beverages (that was brutal) and meditating 10 to 15 minutes every night when I got in bed using Calm, Oak and Headspace apps. I put my iPhone on Do Not Disturb for 11 hours automatically per day and resisted the urge to look at my smartphone if I woke up at night or before sleeping. The end result, I moved from the low 600s to sometimes high 900s in sleep scores. My average sleep score has moved up more than 100. I have more patience, more energy, more memory and more cognitive ability. Amy Miller who wrote a book on Emotional Intelligence said start with sleep. It's the beginning of all health improvements. I have to agree. How can I possibly do more fitness when I feel exhausted? A TED talk on sleep said it's the fountain of youth. But what I have found is that making sleep a priority is hard work. Having the discipline and respect of family members to allow me to stop every day around 8 p.m. is really hard, especially with a 3 year old. In the attached photos, my daughter was crying at 8:45 p.m., when I normally sleep (long and early drive for my commute) and I consoled her about her lost plastic Lego tree for a half hour before she fell asleep around 9:10. It is a credit to Luna that I feel asleep 10 minutes after her. The only con is the capsule style pill is awkward to swallow. I'd prefer a caplet or gummy. I had throat cancer in 2012 and the dry mouth makes the outside of the capsule stick to my throat. It's horrible. But this sleep aid is so amazing, I take it anyway with Premier Protein, a viscous protein drink, that helps it go down.",5,"shock learn get iwatch sleep subpar generally sleep hours per night unaware sleep problems however sleep frequently interrupt bathroom visit per night heart rate dip low light sleep common deep sleep rare make number change include add blackout curtain one window bedroom turn computer night take luna sleep aid rest quit caffeinated beverages brutal meditate minutes every night get bed use calm oak headspace apps put iphone disturb hours automatically per day resist urge look smartphone wake night sleep end result move low sometimes high sleep score average sleep score move patience energy memory cognitive ability amy miller write book emotional intelligence say start sleep begin health improvements agree possibly fitness feel exhaust ted talk sleep say fountain youth find make sleep priority hard work discipline respect family members allow stop every day around p really hard especially year old attach photos daughter cry p normally sleep long early drive commute console lose plastic lego tree half hour fell asleep around credit luna feel asleep minutes con capsule style pill awkward swallow prefer caplet gummy throat cancer dry mouth make outside capsule stick throat horrible sleep aid amaze take anyway premier protein viscous protein drink help go"

He started with half the suggested dose to see how it made him feel first. While it did aid somewhat with him getting to sleep, he ended up having an allergic reaction. More specifically, he got red itchy bumps in the folds of his elbows. Once he discontinued taking it, the rash went away. For those whose body can tolerate it, this sleep aid does seem to be somewhat effective (I say somewhat because he did wake up during the night). *Update* 14 June '17 Wow! This company has thoroughly impressed me. Shortly after posting my review, a company representative sent me an email expressing how sorry they are that my son had an allergic reaction; they issued me a FULL REFUND WITHOUT ME EVEN REQUESTING IT!

She is always ready to fall right to sleep after the 30 minutes and even falls asleep while we read to her before bed.

I started getting ads on FB social media for a free bottle and to send them a message on how to get that free bottle. I purchased my first and second bottle and left the original review by myself but then decided to click the link and see what it was about. Turns out they are offering free second bottles (or third in my case, bc i already bought my second) for 5 star reviews. Just thought the people reading these reviews would want to be aware of this before buying but i still 100% stand by my original review that i posted before i was offered a free bottle for posting a review here on amazon. I also haven’t received my code for a free bottle yet either, i just wanted other people to be aware that some of these reviews may be coming from there. However, it is a great product and wether i get a free bottle or not, i personally am going to continue to purchase this over and over as i use it every single night. ***ORIGINAL REVIEW*** I battle with insomnia. I refuse prescription sleep medince and opt for less invasive drugs and more natural routes. So I’ve tried just about every thing and every otc thing they sell alone. Then i heard that taking blends of a couple things can really make a difference. While this doesn’t necessarily make me fall asleep it does aid in it however it 100% helps me stay asleep and the quality of sleep i get is one million times better. I wake up and never feel groggy or anything like that. I always feel like i just got a good nights sleep on my own. I’ve used most of these ingredients on their own and haven’t had the same success but with this specific blend, it is fantastic. I wasnt thrilled about the price but after using it for the last month i will definitely repurchase and continue to use it every night.

Naps were always short, and despite being an active kid who gets loads of wiggles out throughout the day, and who has a consistent and mellow bedtime routine since she was an infant, and who went through quite a bit of ""sleep training,"" she's rarely been able to sleep through the night. For a brief period of time, around 17-22 months, she did sleep in her own bed all night, but that was a momentary blip of bliss that has yet to organically return. We've tried giving lavender massages, adding calming essential oil blends to her bedroom diffuser, we've used a sound machine since she was a baby, we've tried stretching out bath time, turning down the lights much earlier, and so on. We've tried it all. The real deal insomnia runs in my family as does general trouble sleeping, and I did not want that fate for my daughter. So, now that my daughter is four, I felt it was time to up my game. I started researching natural remedies and came across LUNA. We've used it for the past two nights--giving a tablet to her before bathtime, and right after bathtime, she has been noticeably sleepy--even articulating, ""I'm sleepy"" (words previously never uttered from her sweet little mouth). After only one book into storytime, she was dozing off. I cannot believe it, but she has slept through the night--in her own bed--both nights she took LUNA. She even sleeps through her younger brother's occasional, dreamy squawks. She wakes in the morning well-rested and happy--quite a shift from the groggy little girl I'm used to. She's already showing signs of being proud of her ability to sleep, and--an added benefit I didn't expect--she hasn't wet her Pull-Up the last two nights--something else she's exceedingly proud of. My hunch is that we will use LUNA for a few weeks to help her body and mind form positive sleep habits, then back off for awhile and use LUNA to help maintain those healthy habits when necessary.

"1534169","B00U470TAK","Luna Kids | #1 Sleep Aid Tablets for Children & Sensitive Adults | Naturally Sourced Ingredients | Chewable Pills | Gentle Herbal Supplement with Chamomile, Melatonin, Valerian & Lemon Balm","My daughter was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis in March, ten days after her 5th birthday. She had begun having trouble falling asleep at night around her third birthday. We always thought she was just a night owl, or that she had inherited sleep problems from me, but we came to learn that difficulty falling asleep was a symptom of this autoimmune disease in children. She would describe it to us as being unable close her eyes. They just wouldn’t shut. We figured out that she meant that she was very tired, but could not physically fall asleep. We had tried other natural children's melatonin supplements over the years, but even 1mg of melatonin was too much for her tiny body. She would wake up with night terrors every time she took them. Even when cut in half, she would have restless sleep and wake up much earlier than normal. Upon learning that this was a symptom of her disease and that she would need to take something regularly to help her fall asleep for the foreseeable future, I started looking for something new and stumbled upon Luna Kids. I loved how little melatonin was in it, that it was sugar free and dye free, and that it included other herbs and vitamins. Her pediatric endocrinologist was very happy to see the Vitamin D in it, since people with Hashi's are often deficient in it. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this product! I don’t worry about her taking it every night. It's the slight nudge she needs to fall asleep. On the occasional nights when one is not enough, I have no problem with her taking another, because I know it will not have any adverse effects on her. She has never had a night terror using Luna Kids. She has never woken up groggy, no matter how late she took it. I can let her older brother take one on the rare nights he can’t fall asleep, and I will do the same with her younger brother when he is of age to take it. If you have a child that has trouble falling asleep, try this product! You will not be disappointed. It is safe. It is effective.

My 9 year old has had a tough time falling asleep since he was a baby. Way back then we'd make jokes about how he just wasn't a ""napper"" but that quickly lost its humor when we realized that he was always going to have these issues. By the time he was 3 or 4, it was becoming a real problem for us all. We have a great bedtime routine and are always careful to make sure that he gets the right amount of necessary vitamins and trace minerals paired warm baths, aromatherapy, sleepy time guided meditations and/or beta waves but frequently that wasn't enough. He struggled to fall asleep and would lay there for hours sometimes. He would tell us that he hated bedtime and just wished that he could fall asleep. I can relate as I also have difficulty falling asleep but seeing him go through it was terrible and made us all feel so helpless. I really hated to see him suffer. I knew we needed help but we're very naturally minded so I was hesitant to try just anything. I did a lot of research and spoke with his pediatrician about our options. I was worried about giving anything artificial or with too much Melatonin and his doctor agreed that those things weren't a good idea. We finally had a full panel blood and DNA test run on him and found out that he has a specific variation of the MTHFR mutation which can interfere with your body's natural Melatonin production! This was likely a very big reason why he was having such a hard time sleeping. He DID need to start on a supplement to get his natural production up and a push in the right direction every now and again. We introduced a high quality B12 (L-Methylfolate) vitamin to help with these things and started looking for a sleep supplement that we could use sporadically and would suit his needs. There are a few kids sleep aids out there that claim to be natural and gentle and we went through a couple before we found LUNA. I wanted to try the supplements myself before giving them to him to be sure that they weren't going to be too harsh. The first one we bought contained 1mg of Melatonin per tablet and suggested that you give someone in his age/weight range 2! I took two myself one night (a small dose for me, according to their packaging) and don't remember much after that. When I woke up the next day, I felt like I got hit by a truck. It was anything but pleasant and I certainly didn't feel well rested. More like I was waking up from having been passed out! The next aid we tried was a slightly lower dose of Melatonin but still seemed like too much for me (left me feeling groggy and out of it) so I was worried how he would react to it. (Not only that, they tasted terrible!). Next, I tried LUNA. I loved that it had a low dose of Melatonin (just enough!) was natural, gentle, and GMO-free. I wondered why I hadn't tried it first! It didn't taste bad, helped me to feel sleepy within about 30 minutes of taking them, and I slept soundly through the night. The next morning I woke refreshed like I hadn't taken anything at all. I felt good. I was sold! My son tried them the next time he was having a rough time getting to sleep and he was out within 45 minutes. This is amazing for him! He really likes his LUNA but only asks to take them on nights when he has tried other things and nothing seems to be working. I'd say he takes them 2-3 times a month, on average. They are gentle, non-habit forming, and help to get the job done. We suggest them to all of our friends. We're so glad that we found LUNA and will be customers for a long time to come!

Her son has ADHD and has a problem going to sleep at night. My son's doctor recommended we use Melatonin to help him sleep at night because he has pediatric insomnia. I liked this one because it was such a low dose, and finding something low enough was an issue. With one dose, he was fine. It helped him calm down at night enough to fall asleep. It didn't help with the constant waking, but at least he was going to bed at a decent time. Per the doctor's recommendation, because it wasn't working well anymore, I upped it to two doses at night. That meant he was taking two of the pills. This was still ultimately a low dose. The first time he took two, I noticed he was extra hyper. I chalked it up to a fluke. Then it happened the same way for the next three nights. I had to reach out to his doc, and send a picture of the ingredients to him. The sugar, though natural, could have been a major factor. Another could have been that he's sensitive to Melatonin. So, we switched to another brand that had no sugar or anything else. Just Melatonin. (He's not a fan of the taste) This one, which was a higher dosage, did not make him hyper and he is now only waking once each night. The point of this long explanation is a couple of things. 1. I think the Sugar content may be a smidge high. I get that it needs to taste good for kids to take it, but putting an upper in a downer can cause some issues. His doctor believes that was the issue we ran into. 2. It really depends on the kids. Through this experience, I learned that some people are very sensitive to Melatonin. It can cause night terrors and such. I honestly had no idea. I don't want to give this a bad review because it did help at the single dose and I know a few other parents that love it. However, the sugar content didn't work well with my son, which is ok. Just keep that in mind when you try this.

I drink this as a tea, just add one scoop to boiling water, allow to cool, add raw honey. It's delicious. I wasn't expecting to like this at all. It tastes just like chai tea, just a little weaker. I expected it to be spicier because of some of the other reviews, but if you have ever drank ginger tea the spice level in this will be nothing to you. I personally can't taste the black pepper, just a little of warm spicy ginger flavor. Sometimes I add a little bit of extra cinnamon to it to make it even better It mixes easily, no whisking or stirring needed.

No adverse reactions whatsoever. I have been using this product for almost a week, and I am very much enjoying it!

While there are no cures for Alzheimers, they do find that toxins and inflammation do the damage that can result in this frightening disease that is so hard on families.  Having too many ""brain farts"" to ignore, I set out to do what I could -- on multiple fronts. So when I looked for supplements I could trust, I knew I wanted a brand that was very conscientious in the sources of their ingredients, with the strength I needed, and at a price I could still afford.  I'm so happy to have found a review of supplements that put Naturelo at the top, and then to find they have a very full line of products. Sleep is just one of the many products I now order regularly.  It's an important one because getting enough sleep is my biggest weakness.  Even when I miss taking the whole handful of pills I set up to take daily, I do not ever miss taking Sleep, as well as the Naturelo Vitamin D3 (to counter Osteoporosis). I find that even if I don't think I'm ready for bed, the effect of Sleep, taken a half hour before laying down, is that I easily relax -- without any grogginess -- and I'm out.  I wake up easily in the morning. I am really glad I've found this company and recommend these products wholeheartedly.

It didn't give me heart palpitations or weird dreams like most other sleep remedies do. The next night, didn't feel it working! I ended up getting just three hours sleep.

They do look just like gummy bears, so definitely keep them out of reach so little hands don't get confused and think these are candy to feast on.

I love life and people but I think part of my anxiety is a genetic hyperactivity and being a people pleaser so I really really need the B vitamins that are easily absorbed in Anxiety Formula. And the magnesium helps my restless legs, something I've dealt with for the past few years.Regular B vitamins really hurt my stomach since I have low acid. But I've been able to take Anxiety Formula several times a day without stomach problems. I'm staying ahead of  headaches or panic attacks. EZ Rest Sleep Formula is great. Anyone who deals with anxiety tends to struggle getting to sleep and/or staying asleep. Sometimes I just stay up because there is no point in tossing and turning. I've been taking two Sleep Formula tablets for about a week and am sleeping much better. I'm recovering from rotator cuff surgery and the pain meds keep me awake. After a sleepless night I actually took Sleep Formula and was able to take a 3 hour nap during the day. The formula has not only melatonin and valerian but L-Trryptophan which I used successfully 20 years ago. Plus B6. So it is really treating the problem, not just putting a bandaid on it. I would definitely recommend this combination. I take more than prescribed since I have pretty extreme anxiety and insomnia but stick with the directions and test it out for yourself. The main thing is that both have natural absorbable vitamins that treat the problem and not just the symptoms.

The anxiety and sleep combination pack has been wonderful for him and both my son and myself are happy with the results.  The first day my son took the anxiety pill, he noticed a difference in his mood, literally by mid day I noticed he was calmer.  He has been using these for awhile and the fact he is calmer, he feels less stressed and doesn't get angry as fast, it really has been because of using the anxiety pill.  I say that because he hasn't been taking anything prescribed for his anxiety, the only mood elevator has been using is this pill.  To go from always being on edge to a calmer and joyful mood, I cannot say enough about this product. I myself used the sleep pill and within about a hour, I knew it had worked because I was asleep.  I didn't feel jittery or dizzy, I simply was relaxed enough to fall asleep.  They only ""side effect"" I will call it, is mild loose stools that occur after the first day of using these pills.  When my son and I compare results, he agreed he also had the same side effect but we think it's because the label reads a vegetable ingredient.  We all know what vegetables do and that side effect was tolerable.  Does the sleep pill help you fall asleep?  Yes. Does the anxiety pill work?  Yes. It really is a good feeling to know I purchased a product that helps him.  I would highly recommend using this if you want to try something that can balance your mood and help with insomnia without putting chemicals from prescribed meds in your body.

(I used to take melatonin by itself and sometimes woke with a bit of a headache.) I need to get a written log going to have more objective thoughts on the 2 choices (non-melatonin vs melatonin).",4,"sleep aid seem work well keep deep restful sleep however sure help get sleep faster nights may much coffee earlier day late dinners travel business also buy luna version melatonin mg per pill seem make feel ever slightly groggy wake use take melatonin sometimes wake bite headache need get write log go objective thoughts choices non melatonin vs melatonin"

I used last night and I was able to get to sleep hours sooner than usual. The first thing I noticed was mostly feeling relaxed and that made sleep easier. Since I have anxiety as well I researched these ingredients and they are also helpful for anxiety so I think once the anxiety was gone it allowed me to sleep.

Also buying the chewables for a family member. Mixed review. Great on how it works, five stars. However, when I opened the current bottle some of the capsules had dent marks, some larger like not closed up properly, a couple not entirely filled. I am ""assuming"" this is a factory issue BUT concerned enough that I don't want to take. The bottle didn't have a plastic seal around the top and the top wasnt tight. The inner seal was OK but one end a tad ripped, but that could easily have been a minor factory processing issue.

Two problems with that... it seemed like playing roulette sometimes I’d end up wired and wouldn’t sleep at all. Secondly I learned that taking melatonin repeatedly can mess with your hormone level due to your body trying to balance things out. I started taking valerian root but wanted something a little more potent and I found this as an alternative aid minus the melatonin. It’s helped me to stay asleep better without the random nights that I end up wired instead.
